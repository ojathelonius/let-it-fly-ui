## User story
In case of an overbooked flight, passengers can quickly reschedule their trip and avoid boring waiting times by finding entertainment sources nearby, customized for their profile.

* Book alternate flights, local activites or hotels
* Try switching profiles in the "My Profile" page to see how it affects your custom picked activities

## Data
The app displays data coming from the provided API as part of the challenge resources, as well as dummy data stored as JSON that is quite similar to the one you could get from real services, such as :
* AirBnB
* Booking.com
* TripAdvisor

Unfortunately these websites do not provide API for development projects, thus we had to create our own data.
